# Project Description
My friend came up with this idea: you have a time tracker or money tracker that tracks how much money you can make instead of scrolling on your phone.
I like to make things so I decided to give it a shot. I think in total, this project took around 3 days of coding as I have never coded an Android application (this project
is not possible for iOS), and most of this was decoding. The final product is an app where you can input what you believe is your hourly worth (how much you think your time is worth)
and then a small draggable OverlayService that stays at the front of your screen will display how much time in money has been wasted from using your phone. 

## Features
- You can Pause and Resume a session
- The Overlay Circle is draggable to the corners of the screen
- The Overlay Circle will always be at the top of the screen

## Potential improvements
Although the essentials of this app have been completed, there remain a few things that I might want to add that would entice more users to use it, and perhaps, make 
the user experience, overall, more pleasant
1. Animate the disappearance and appearance of buttons - as of right now, buttons in the app are appearing and disappearing during the transition between different states of the app, giving the app an overall choppy feeling. In the future, I might animate this a little bit to make everything a bit softer on the eyes
2. I would probably add a stats page too - the home page feels empty and would be better filled with statistics like how much money you wasted in the past week, month, year, etc

## What I learned
Over the process of making this product, I got a quick crash course on Kotlin, how to create applications that are based on time, how to create Overlay Service applications, and how
to make different views of the app (specifically the main page where all of the variables were stored and the overlay service) talk to each other. Overall, it was a nice and
quick development experience and I hope it looks decently professional
